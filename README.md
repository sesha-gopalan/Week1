# Week3
After the graphs, the notebook focuses on feature selection, model training, and evaluation using Linear Regression for solar power prediction. It preprocesses data, splits it for training/testing, and evaluates performance with MAE, MSE, and RÂ² scores. Results highlight key factors influencing power generation. The notebook suggests improvements like advanced models (Random Forest, Neural Networks) and hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
